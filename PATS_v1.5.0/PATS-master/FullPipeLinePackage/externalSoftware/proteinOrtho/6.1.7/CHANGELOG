		protein output is now sorted in descending degree-order (sort with comparator_pairDoubleUInt)
		getConnectivity: special case checks now if the induced subgraph is complete (K_n)
		added various test functions
	5. July
		added kmere heuristic for splitting groups in proteinortho_clustering. After the calculation of an fiedler vector, the kmere heuristic splits the graph not only in the positive and negative entries of the vector but in k clusters. k=2 -> the original split (without the purity).  
	16. July
		added LAPACK support for CC with less than 2^15 nodes (since it uses quadratic space -> (2^15)^2=2^30) for the calculation of the algebraic connectivity.
		added all other proteinortho files to this repository.
		graphMinusRemoveGraph.cpp implements proteinortho5_clean_edges2.pl in c++
	23.July
		openMP support for laplacian declaration (for lapack).
		'make test' clean up.
		jackhmmer, phmmer, diamond, usearch support.
	24 July
		last integration.

		proteinortho.pl : set cluster algorithm to weighted-mode as default.
	30. July
		rapsearch integration.
		proteinortho_clustering.cpp : -ramLapack is now -ram and is the threshold for laplace matrix + graph struct. 
		added dynamic memory management (proteinortho.pl + clustering.cpp) using the free -m command (if exists) 
	31. July
		rapsearch fix (wrong order of db and q)
		purity is back, now 0.1 (and fallback function, if all nodes are below purity threshold -> remove purity for this connected component)
		more options for proteinortho.pl -p=diamond-moresensitive|usearch-ublast
	9. Aug
		topaz integeration.
		all DBs now have the blastmode in name (colliding names) as well as the tmp files generated by the blastalgos.
	10. Aug
		Orthology XML integration. Added the option -noxml for not generating the orthology XML format.
	13. Aug
		bugfix usearch/ublast: removed the description from the gene name (formatU.pl). bugfix rapsearch: forced to create an output .m8 file if there are no hits found.
		allowedAlphabet check in read_details in check_files. E.g. diamond expects aminoacid characters -> found a gene with only nucleotide characters -> WARNING. E.g. blastn+ expects nucleotide characters -> found non nucleotide characters -> ERROR.
	22. Aug
		removed phmmer and jackhmmer. 
		removed the -p=diamondmoresensitive option, since it is equivalent to -p=diamond -subpara='--moresensitive'.
#       redesigned the multithreading system: 
#       -cpus=x -> spawn round(sqrt(x)) workerthreads with each ceil(sqrt(x)) (different for the last workerthread ...) cores for blast. 
#       removed threads_per_process function.
	8. Sep
		proteinortho_clustering: introduced multithreading in partition_graph() -> generate k CC and compute the lapack dsyevx in parallel (1. Memory check 2. if a large CC is found -> 1 power iteration with all cores 3. else do k lapack.). New const variable lapack_power_threshold_n for determining large CC for the power iteration.   
	4. Okt
		improvement in the memory calculations. 
		BUGfix in the DFS calculation (recursion in c++ failed with segmentation fault if the recursion was too deep) -> now iteratively (memory ineffciently) with Queue
	10. Okt
		DFS -> BFS since recursive calls can only be so deep.
	18. Okt
		purity is now 1e-7, evalue 1e-8 (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/power_method/power_method_prb.c)
		kmere heuristic minNodes = 2^20 (~1e+6), kmere now checks if the "normal" split would result in a good partition.
	30. Okt
		- removed the memory manager for proteinortho_clustering, instead a simple n threshold manages the power/lapack algorithms
		now all CC are calculated for power/lapack (no frequent restart), dynamic for loop for lapack
	7. Nov
		dsyevr instead of dsyevx (rrr algorithm now)
		remove graph bugfix (each thread is now assigned an own ofstream (shared_ptr needed -> c++11 needed))
	13. Nov
		OMP_PROC_BIND=close for multi-socket systems (change the cpu affinity of openmp to close -> each new thread spawn next to the last one, instead of randomly)
	15. Nov
		Blat support (step=2), the evalues cannot be preset as a parameter but appear if -out=blast8 is set.
	16. Nov
		proteinoprtho 6.0 alpha release
	28. Nov

	25. Dec
		no lapack version (src/proteinortho_clustering_nolapack.cpp)
		no cmake version (make all_nocmake, needs lapack installed)
2019
	9. Jan
		pow_n replaced with powLapD (graph density threshold instead of number of nodes)
	11. Jan
		mmseq2 integration (proteinortho.pl) -p=mmseqsp or mmseqsn 
	22. Jan (uid:296)
		Added CHAGEUID for a commit specific id. (update_CHANGEUID.sh can be found in snippets, use 'find . -maxdepth 2 | perl -lne '{if($_=~m/^.*(\.pl|\.cpp|\.c|\.h|\.md|\.txt|Makefile|CHANGELOG)$/){print $_;}}' | entr bash update_CHANGEUID.sh')

	14. Mar (uid: 1034)
		-tmp is now working better (tmp_dir now generates a directory with all temporary files inside)

		output files are overwritten instead of appended (which makes no sense)
		selfblast option does now ignore hits between the same protein automatically (before cleanupblastgraph was used)

		proteinortho detects if input files are not fasta formatted and throws an error message instead of crashing
	9. June (5930) v6.1.0
		major:
		main overhaul of the multithreading system of proteinortho_clustering.cpp now using c++11 worker threads instead of a plain openMP. The new system now uses the provided cores more efficiently
		added -core parameter to proteinortho_clustering.cpp (and the main perl script): stop clustering if a group would split into groups that dont span all species and only output groups that span across all species

		small:
		added --identical to proteinortho6.pl: return only entries that are 100% identical
		added --range= to proteinortho6.pl: 
		small improvements to log output of proteinortho6.pl and quality of life changes, e.g. -sim=90 is automatically corrected to -sim=.9
		added a new -core, -noco and -singles feature to proteinortho_grab_proteins.pl to extract core proteomes more easily
		update to proteinortho_summary.pl: now it displays descriptive statistics about the group file (automatically detected based on the input name), e.g. number of groups that span across all species (core groups)
		proteinortho_clustering.cpp now uses double precision as fallback
		removed doxygen
		-h and --help are now the same (-h previously displayed a short usage)
		
		bugfixes:
		fixed a bug where 'proteinortho_clustering -kmere 0' still used the kmere heuristic as fallback + -exactStep3 is now the default
		fixed a bug where a multithreaded BLAS libraries (if linked against LAPACK) oversubscribes the -cpu thread limitation, thanks Hendrick
	29. June (5990) v6.1.1
		-core now also is applicable to groups that are sub-optimal (that do not span all species initally).
		-small adjustments to summary output

		- BUGFIX: remove.graph was missing edges removed from purity
	24. Okt (6041) v6.1.2
		- BUGFIX: proteinortho2html some times got the , wrong in the pop-up window.
	4. Nov (6042) v6.1.3
		- small bugfix: when cleaning data on symlinks, the new "X_clean" files are generated in abs_path which may not be in the input directory! 
		- removed the precompiled proteinortho_treeBuilderCore as virustotal is not happy with this file (false positive hit: #65, thanks to Björn for pointing this out)

	23. Nov (6056) v6.1.5
		- bugfix: proteinortho_clustering -core will split before evaluating the cluster
		- improvement: proteinortho_clustering the new purity detection was too careful (resulting in very long runtimes), now only a fixed number of purities are tested improving the runtime dramatically for large inputs
		- bugfix: the bug of #69 was not fixed entirely
	23. Nov (6060) v6.1.5

		- small bugfix for -step=1 and input files with forbidden symbols (invalid fasta files)
	30. Nov (6070) v6.1.6

		- new feature: a fallback system for the blast commands of step=2: if e.g. a diamond calls zombifies (0% cpup running without terminating), proteinortho automatically detects this and restarts this comparison a few times instead of running indefinitely waiting on diamond
	6. Dec (6081) v6.1.6
		- disabled the fallback system for mmseqs as mmseqs spawns the true workload in another thread
	12. Dec (6082) v6.1.6
