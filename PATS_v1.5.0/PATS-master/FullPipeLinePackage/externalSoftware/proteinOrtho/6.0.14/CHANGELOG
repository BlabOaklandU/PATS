        Added tool to compare graph files (comp_bla.pl)
    03-05: Proteinortho V5.05 - Source code

2018 Proteinortho6
    20.Juni-4.Juli
        openmp support (max_of_diag,get_new_x,makeOrthogonal,normalize,getY)
        bitscore integration in the convergence (weighted algebraic connectivity)
        protein output is now sorted in descending degree-order (sort with comparator_pairDoubleUInt)
        getConnectivity: special case checks now if the induced subgraph is complete (K_n)
        added various test functions
    5. Juli
        added kmere heuristic for splitting groups in proteinortho_clustering. After the calculation of an fiedler vector, the kmere heuristic splits the graph not only in the positive and negative entries of the vector but in k clusters. k=2 -> the original split (without the purity).  
    16. Juli
        added LAPACK support for CC with less than 2^15 nodes (since it uses quadratic space -> (2^15)^2=2^30) for the calculation of the algebraic connectivity.
        added all other proteinortho files to this repository.
        graphMinusRemoveGraph.cpp implements proteinortho5_clean_edges2.pl in c++
    23.Juli
        openMP support for laplacian declaration (for lapack).
        'make test' clean up.
        jackhmmer, phmmer, diamond, usearch support.
    24 Juli
        last integration.
        phmmer+jackhmmer fix/workaround (there is no local identity in the output -> disabled).
        proteinortho.pl : set cluster algorithm to weighted-mode as default.
    30. Juli
        rapsearch integration.
        proteinortho_clustering.cpp : -ramLapack is now -ram and is the threshold for laplace matrix + graph struct. 
        added dynamic memory management (proteinortho.pl + clustering.cpp) using the free -m command (if exists) 
    31. Juli
        rapsearch fix (wrong order of db and q)
        purity is back, now 0.1 (and fallback function, if all nodes are below purity threshold -> remove purity for this connected component)
        more options for proteinortho.pl -p=diamond-moresensitive|usearch-ublast
    9. Aug
        topaz integeration.
        all DBs now have the blastmode in name (colliding names) as well as the tmp files generated by the blastalgos.
    10. Aug
        Orthology XML integration. Added the option -noxml for not generating the orthology XML format.
    13. Aug
        bugfix usearch/ublast: removed the description from the gene name (formatU.pl). bugfix rapsearch: forced to create an output .m8 file if there are no hits found.
        allowedAlphabet check in read_details in check_files. E.g. diamond expects aminoacid characters -> found a gene with only nucleotide characters -> WARNING. E.g. blastn+ expects nucleotide characters -> found non nucleotide characters -> ERROR.
    22. Aug
        removed phmmer and jackhmmer. 
        removed the -p=diamondmoresensitive option, since it is equivalent to -p=diamond -subpara='--moresensitive'.
#           redesigned the multithreading system: 
#            -cpus=x -> spawn round(sqrt(x)) workerthreads with each ceil(sqrt(x)) (different for the last workerthread ...) cores for blast. 
#            removed threads_per_process function.
    8. Sep
        proteinortho_clustering: introduced multithreading in partition_graph() -> generate k CC and compute the lapack dsyevx in parallel (1. Memory check 2. if a large CC is found -> 1 power iteration with all cores 3. else do k lapack.). New const variable lapack_power_threshold_n for determining large CC for the power iteration.   
    4. Okt
        improvement in the memory calculations. 
        BUGfix in the DFS calculation (recursion in c++ failed with segmentation fault if the recursion was too deep) -> now iteratively (memory ineffciently) with Queue
    10. Okt
        DFS -> BFS since recursive calls can only be so deep.
    18.  Okt
        purity is now 1e-7, evalue 1e-8 (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/power_method/power_method_prb.c)
        kmere heuristic minNodes = 2^20 (~1e+6), kmere now checks if the "normal" split would result in a good partition.
    30. Okt
        - removed the memory manager for proteinortho_clustering, instead a simple n threshold manages the power/lapack algorithms
        now all CC are calculated for power/lapack (no frequent restart), dynamic for loop for lapack
    7. Nov
        dsyevr instead of dsyevx (rrr algorithm now)
        remove graph bugfix (each thread is now assigned an own ofstream (shared_ptr needed -> c++11 needed))
    13. Nov
        OMP_PROC_BIND=close for multi-socket systems (change the cpu affinity of openmp to close -> each new thread spawn next to the last one, instead of randomly)
    15. Nov
        Blat support (step=2), the evalues cannot be preset as a parameter but appear if -out=blast8 is set.
    16. Nov
        proteinoprtho 6.0 alpha release
    28. Nov
        Makefile update (lapack zipped,...)
    5. Dez
        MCL integration (-mcl option in proteinortho.pl)
        XML bugfix (species with . in the name did confuse the xml parser)
    6. Dez
        MCL pre/postprocessing (src/do_mcl.pl)
        double -> float in proteinortho_clustering.cpp
        weights are unsigned shorts again (only the last commit was unsigned int) proteinortho_clustering.cpp
    10. Dez
        gff4fasta update: Test for additional naming schemes
    20.-21. Dez
        src/do_mcl.pl performance increase, dev/blastgraph2CCblastgraphs.cpp improvement
        orthoXML improvement (still not accepted by orthobechmarkproject)
    25. Dez
        no lapack version (src/proteinortho_clustering_nolapack.cpp)
        no cmake version (make all_nocmake, needs lapack installed)
2019
    9. Jan
        pow_n replaced with powLapD (graph density threshold instead of number of nodes)
    11. Jan
        mmseq2 integration (proteinortho.pl) -p=mmseqsp or mmseqsn 
    22. Jan (uid:296)
        Added CHAGEUID for a commit specific id. (update_CHANGEUID.sh can be found in snippets, use 'find . -maxdepth 2 | perl -lne '{if($_=~m/^.*(\.pl|\.cpp|\.c|\.h|\.md|\.txt|Makefile|CHANGELOG)$/){print $_;}}' | entr bash update_CHANGEUID.sh')
        BUGfix: weird sort behaviour dependant on locale (LC_All,LC_NUMERIC). Fix: $ENV{'LC_All'}='C';
    23. Jan (uid:492) v6.0a
        small fix for get_po_path
    4. Feb (uid:724)
        -ram is back for memory control of proteinortho_clustering (restricts the memory usage of LAPACK and the input graph), works also for proteinortho.pl -ram
    14. Mar (uid: 1034)
        -tmp is now working better (tmp_dir now generates a directory with all temporary files inside)
        read_details now checks if the input files are faa and fna type based on the -p algorithm (diamond only uses faa files etcpp) IF -checkfasta
    20. Mar (uid: 1174)
        static versions (Linux/x64) of all binaries are now included in the repository
        Makefile now compiles first against /usr/lib/liblapack statically then it tries to recompile src/lapack automatically with 'make'

        html improvement (now you can display alternative names from the fasta files)
        new minspecies default (1)
    19. Mai (uid:3063)
        proteinorthoHelper.html
    21. Mai (uid:3080)
	    minspecies 1 fix (previously 1 => disabled minspecies calculations)
    22. Mai (uid:3140)
	    -selfblast generates duplicated hits -> automatically calls cleanupblastgraph
    3. Juni (uid:3142)
	    refined error messages on duplicated inputs, <2 inputs
    27. Juni (uid:3492)
        proteinortho6.pl now writes databases (-step=1) into -tmp directory if system call failed.
        fixed small issue that tmp directories are created inside eachother. 
        better stderr outputs e.g. if blast fails -> try -check ...
    1. Juli (uid:3511)
	    fixed the -ram issue (used free memory, now total memory) in case there is a swap using up all free memory (also proteinortho_clustering now throws a warning not a error)
    10. Juli (uid:3697)
        fixed proteinortho_grab_proteins.pl: -tofiles option now escapes if -exact, replaced chomp with s/[\r\n]+$//
        proteinortho_grab_proteins.pl speedup for -exact and a given proteinortho file
        proteinortho6.pl replaced chomp with s/[\r\n]+$//
        proteinortho_clustering.cpp fix bug that only uses lapack if -pld is set, regardless of the value.
    11. Sept (uid: 3813)
		updated shebang of ffadj such that python2.7 is used directly (ffadj fails if called with higher version of python)
		-p=blastp is now alias of blastp+ and legacy blast is now -p=blastp_legacy (blastn is equivalent)
		Makefile: static now includes -lquadmath
    25. Sept (uid: 3899)
		synteny update to python3 (but the code looks fishy, the -synteny option now gets a deprecated warning)
		proteinortho now only print html for <10 files automatically and otherwise only gives the option
    4. Nov (uid: 4020)
		FIXED: sometimes the python3 version produces one edditional edge (global defintion of ALPHA). Special thanks for this update goes to Daniel Doerr for fixing this.
	25. Nov (uid: 4030)
		added proteinortho_history
		the synteny option ffadj is now not depricated anymore
    10. Dec (uid: 4196)
    	improved proteinortho_history
    	removed the new diamond spam
        + added proteinortho_summary.pl for a summary of proteinortho-graph on species level.

        added the -isoform option 
        added -p=autoblast
    6. Feb (uid: 4745)
	autoblast and -cov now are working together (nucl vs prot -> coverage is in aa length, nucl vs nucl -> cov is in nucl lengths, converted all lengths to aa and alignmentlen/3 for nucl vs nucl)
